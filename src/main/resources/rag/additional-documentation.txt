What is a Cron Expression?
Cron is a typical Unix utility that is used to schedule a task for automatic execution of it at particular intervals. For example, you might have a task that generates a specific pdf report from your application and you want to generate this report weekly on Monday automatically at 9:00 AM.
A cron expression is a string consisting of six or seven subexpressions (fields) that describe individual details of the schedule. These fields, separated by white space, can contain any of the allowed values with various combinations of the allowed characters for that field. Below picture shows the fields in the expected order and allowed values with characters.

Note: As per the Spring Framework’s documentation, the allowed values for the field ‘day of week’ are 0-7. Here ‘0’ or ‘7’ both represent ‘Sunday’. Hence, below listings shows the clear mapping of days with numbers.

Spring Scheduling Cron Expression0 = Sunday
1 = Monday
2 = Tuesday
3 = Wednesday
4 = Thursday
5 = Friday
6 = Saturday
7 = Sunday

Note: The previous versions and the latest Spring 6.0 supports six fields in the cron expression: second, minute, hour, day of month, month and day of week. The parse( ) method of CronExpression class provided by the Spring Framework says that if fields’ length is not equal to 6, you will face IllegalArgumentException. Below code snippet is from parse( ) method of CronExpression class.

if (fields.length != 6) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException(String.format(
         "Cron expression must consist of 6 fields (found %d in \"%s\")", fields.length, expression));
}
How To Write a Cron Expression?
Let’s understand the complete description of a cron expression, including each allowed characters and how to write a Spring Scheduling Cron Expression.

1) There are 6 Asterisks (* * * * * *) by default as a placeholder in cron expression as shown in the picture above. Further, each asterisk represents a value. These values can be assigned as Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Day Of Month, Month, Day Of Week respectively in the sequence.
Allowed values at proper place are also given in the picture above.

2) A Cron Expression can accept symbols : *  –   ,   /   ?   L   W  #

3) Comma denotes possible values separated by comma
For example, the expression “0 0 4,14 * * *” denotes ‘4:00:00AM and 2:00:00 PM every day’.

4) Dash (-) denotes a range, which means, considering all possible values between the range. Ranges of numbers are expressed by two numbers separated with a hyphen. The specified range is inclusive.

For example, the expression ”0 0 2-4 * * *” just denotes ‘execute given task every day 2:00:00AM, 3:00:00AM and 4:00:00AM’.

5) Asterisk(*) denotes any/every/all value

For example, the expression “0 0 * * * *” denotes ‘the top of every hour of every day’ or in simple terms ‘hourly’.

6) Forward slash(/) denotes a period of time

For example, the expression “0 0/30 2-4 * * *” denotes ‘2:00, 2:30, 3:00, 3:30, 4:00 and 4:30AM every day’.

7) Question mark(?) denotes any value like *, but it can be used for the ‘day of the month’ or ‘day of the week’ fields instead of an asterisk.

8) English names can also be used for the month and the day-of-week fields. Use the first three letters of the particular day of week or month (case does not matter). While writing a Spring Scheduling Cron Expression, it is advisable to use English names for the ‘day-of-week’ and ‘months’ instead of numbers, as they are self explanatory and also eliminates the chances of making mistakes.

For example, 11 = NOV and 5 = FRI

9) L: The ‘day of month’ and ‘day of week’ fields can contain an ‘L’ character, which stands for ‘last’, and has a different meaning in each field. In the ‘day of month’ field, L stands for ‘the last day of the month’. If followed by a negative offset i.e. ‘L-n’, it means ‘nth-to-last day of the month’. For example, L-3 = third-to-last day of the month. If followed by W i.e. ‘LW’, it means ‘the last weekday of the month’.

In the ‘day of week’ field, L stands for ‘the last day of the week’. If prefixed by a number or three-letter name i.e. ‘nL’ or ‘DDDL’, it means “the last day of week ‘n’ or ‘DDD’ in the month” respectively.

For example, 5L = last Friday of the month. TUEL = last Tuesday of the month.

10) W: The character ‘W’ is applicable to the ‘day of month’ only. The ‘day of month’ field can be ‘nW’, which stands for ‘the nearest weekday to day of the month n’.

For example, ‘1W’ stands for the ‘first weekday of the month’. ‘4W’ stands for the ‘fourth weekday of the month’. ‘LW’ stands for the ‘last weekday of the month’.

If n falls on Saturday, this returns the Friday. On the other hand, if n falls on Sunday, this returns the Monday.

11) #: The character ‘#’ is applicable to the ‘day of week’ only. The ‘day of week’ field can be ‘d#n’ or ‘DDD#n’, which stands for ‘the n-th day of week d or DDD in the month’.

For example, 5#3 = the third Friday in the month. WED#1 = the first Wednesday in the month.

12) C: The ‘C’ character is shorthand for “calendar” and is only allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. This means values are calculated against the associated calendar, if any. If no calendar is associated, then it is equivalent to having an all-inclusive calendar.

For example, a value of ‘5C’ in the day-of-month field refers to ‘the first day included by the calendar on or after the 5th’. A value of  ‘1C’ in the day-of-week field means ‘the first day included by the calendar on or after Sunday’.

The character ‘C’ is very rarely used and even doesn’t exist in Spring 5.3 improvements. Moreover, the new CronExpression class provided by Spring 5.3 is based on ‘java.time’ APIs in contrast to CronSequesnce class in older versions which was based on ‘java.util.Calendar’ APIs.

Where To Use Cron Expression In a Spring based Application?
Cron expressions are mostly used in Spring applications through the @Scheduled annotation. @Scheduled is a method level annotation applied at runtime to mark the method to be scheduled. Once we finalize the method where we require scheduling, we apply @Scheduled annotation on it with cron attribute. This ‘cron’ attribute accepts the cron expression. For example, below code snippet demonstrates the concepts of using Spring Scheduling cron expression with the @Scheduled annotation.

import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class SchedulerService {

   @Scheduled(cron = "15 * * * * *")
   public void scheduledMethod() {
      System.out.println("Hello cron Scheduler Service: " +LocalDateTime.now());
   }
}
Specifically, the cron expression in the above program indicates the execution of a task at every minute 15th second.

The CronExpression Class: Since Spring 5.3
The CronExpression class introduced in Spring 5.3 handles the cron expression. It replaces the CronSequenceGenerator (Deprecated Since Spring 5.3) class. CronSequenceGenerator class was based on ‘java.util.Calendar’ which has several known issues that none of the Spring team members felt comfortable solving. On the other hand, the new class CronExpression offers us to use the modern & superior ‘java.time’ APIs, solves the outstanding issues, and initiates new features as well.

If you want to play around with CronExpression yourself, you can create one through the static parse method. For example:

import org.springframework.scheduling.support.CronExpression;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

var expression = CronExpression.parse("15 * * * * *");
var result = expression.next(LocalDateTime.now());
System.out.println(result);
In the code sample above,expression represents a cron expression that triggers 15 seconds past every minute. The parse( ) method takes the string with six space-separated time and date fields.

New Features as Corn Expression Improvements in Spring 5.3
Although we have already covered the new features & improvements of Spring Scheduling Cron Expression in the section ‘how to write a cron expression’ except macros, but we will specifically talk about it here in this section. These improvements are available in Spring Boot as well since Spring Boot 2.4.

Macros
Spring now supports the some macros, which represent commonly used sequences in order to improve readability. Even we can use these macros rather than writing the six-digit values. They will not only save your time, but also eliminate the chances of making mistakes. Below is the list of macros that we can use in our code in case of Spring 5.3 or later versions.

1) For Once a Year:    @yearly or @annually  in place of  “0 0 0 1 1 *”

2) For Once a Month: @monthly in place of  “0 0 0 1 * *”

3) For Once a Week:   @weekly in place of  “0 0 0 * * 0”

4) For Once a Day:     @daily or @midnight in place of  “0 0 0 * * *”

5) For Once an Hour: @hourly in place of  “0 0 * * * *”

Last Days (L)
The character ‘L’ stands for last. We can use this character in the ‘day of month’ and ‘day of week’ fields. Complete details on how to use this character are described in the section ”how to write a cron expression” of this article. Let’s take some examples:

Cron Expression	Meaning
0 0 0 L * *

Last day of the month at midnight

0 0 0 L-2 * *

Second-to-last day of the month at midnight

0 0 0 * * 4L

Last Thursday of the month at midnight

0 0 0 * * MONL

Last Monday of the month at midnight

Weekdays (W)
The character ‘W’ stands for Weekdays. We can use this character in the ‘day of month’ field. Complete details on how to use this character are described in the section ”how to write a cron expression” of this article. Let’s see some examples:

Cron Expression	Meaning
0 0 0 1W * *

First weekday of the month at midnight

0 0 0 LW * *

Last weekday of the month at midnight

Day of the Week in the Month (#)
The character ‘#’ is applicable to the ‘day of week’ only. The ‘day of week’ field can be ‘d#n’ or ‘DDD#n’, which stands for ‘the n-th day of week d or DDD in the month’. Let’s see some examples:

Cron Expression	Meaning
0 0 0 ? * 5#3

The third Friday in the month at midnight
0 0 0 ? * SUN#1

The first Sunday in the month at midnight

FAQ
What are the guidelines to use @Scheduled Annotation?
@Scheduled is a method level annotation applied at runtime to mark the method to be scheduled. Any method using @Scheduled needs to satisfy two conditions:

1) The annotated method should not have a return type. Otherwise the return value will be overlooked at runtime.

2) The annotated method should not accept any input parameters.

What are the improvements in cron expressions introduced with the Spring 5.3 release?
Spring 5.3 introduced improvements in the Spring Scheduling Cron Expression as shown below:

1) The CronExpression class introduced in Spring 5.3. It replaces the CronSequenceGenerator class.

2) Macros: Macros as an alternative to the six-digit values to make cron expression simple and easy to understand.

3) Three new characters in cron expressions : L, W, and  #

Conclusion
We have discussed the concepts of Spring Scheduling Cron Expression at length, including ample amounts of examples in this article. Moreover, we have also discussed improvements in Cron Expressions in Spring 5.3. After going through this article, you should be able to write a Spring Scheduling Cron Expression confidently. I hope, you will also apply the learned concepts in your project. Furthermore, if there will be more improvements in the future, we will also update the article accordingly.

New in Spring 5.3: Improved Cron Expressions
Engineering | Arjen Poutsma | November 10, 2020 | 16 Comments
If you regularly listen to A Bootiful Podcast, you might have heard about the improvements we made to Spring Framework’s cron support. Cron expressions are mostly used in Spring applications through the @Scheduled annotation. In Spring 5.3, we introduced the CronExpression class, which represents — you guessed it — a cron expression.

CronExpression replaces CronSequenceGenerator, which is based on java.util.Calendar and which has several known issues that none of the Spring team members felt comfortable solving. Introducing a new type allowed us to use the superior java.time APIs, solve the outstanding issues, and (hopefully) introduce new features as well. While Spring generally prefers to maintain backward compatible, sometimes we do believe that starting from scratch is the best option.

Usage
You typically create cron triggers with the @Scheduled annotation, which uses CronExpression internally, as of Spring Framework 5.3. This means that you can already start using the New Features if you are on that version.

If you want to play around with CronExpression yourself, you can create one through the static parse method:

var expression = CronExpression.parse("10 * * * * *");
var result = expression.next(LocalDateTime.now());
System.out.println(result);
In this sample, expression represents a cron sequence that triggers 10 seconds past every minute. The parse method takes the well-known string with six space-separated time and date fields:

 ┌───────────── second (0-59)
 │ ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
 │ │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
 │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
 │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12) (or JAN-DEC)
 │ │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 7)
 │ │ │ │ │ │          (0 or 7 is Sunday, or MON-SUN)
 │ │ │ │ │ │
 * * * * * *

Some rules apply:

A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for “first-last”. For the day-of-the-month or day-of-the-week fields, a question mark (?) may be used instead of an asterisk.

Commas (,) are used to separate items of a list.

Two numbers separated with a hyphen (-) express a range of numbers. The specified range is inclusive.

Following a range (or *) with / specifies the interval of the number’s value through the range.

English names can also be used for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. Use the first three letters of the particular day or month (case does not matter).

Here are some examples:

Cron Expression

Meaning

0 0 * * * *

top of every hour of every day

*/10 * * * * *

every ten seconds

0 0 8-10 * * *

8, 9 and 10 o’clock of every day

0 0 6,19 * * *

6:00 AM and 7:00 PM every day

0 0/30 8-10 * * *

8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30, 10:00 and 10:30 every day

0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI

on the hour nine-to-five weekdays

0 0 0 25 12 ?

every Christmas Day at midnight

The next method returns the next occurrence of the trigger or null if there is none. It takes a java.time.temporal.Temporal as a parameter, which means it accepts not only LocalDateTime but also ZonedDateTime if time-zones are relevant.

New Features
Using the java.time APIs let us introduce several new features that put Spring’s support for cron expressions on an equal footing with other schedulers. You can start using these features in @Scheduled as of Spring Framework 5.3.

Macros
Expressions such as 0 0 * * * * are hard for humans to parse and are, therefore, hard to fix in case of bugs. To improve readability, Spring now supports the following macros, which represent commonly used sequences. You can use these macros instead of the six-digit value, thus: @Scheduled(cron = "@hourly").

Macro

Meaning

@yearly (or @annually)

once a year (0 0 0 1 1 *)

@monthly

once a month (0 0 0 1 * *)

@weekly

once a week (0 0 0 * * 0)

@daily (or @midnight)

once a day (0 0 0 * * *), or

@hourly

once an hour, (0 0 * * * *)

Last Days
The day-of-month and day-of-week fields can contain a L character, which has a different meaning in each field. In the day-of-month field, L stands for the last day of the month. If followed by a negative offset (that is, L-n), it means nth-to-last day of the month.

In the day-of-week field, L stands for the last day of the week. If prefixed by a number or three-letter name (dL or DDDL), it means the last day of week (d or DDD) in the month.

Here are some examples:

Cron Expression

Meaning

0 0 0 L * *

last day of the month at midnight

0 0 0 L-3 * *

third-to-last day of the month at midnight

0 0 0 * * 5L

last Friday of the month at midnight

0 0 0 * * THUL

last Thursday of the month at midnight

Weekdays
The day-of-month field can be nW, which stands for the nearest weekday to day of the month n. If n falls on Saturday, this yields the Friday before it. If n falls on Sunday, this yields the Monday after, which also happens if n is 1 and falls on a Saturday (that is: 1W stands for the first weekday of the month).

If the day-of-month field is LW, it means the last weekday of the month.

Here are some examples:

Cron Expression

Meaning

0 0 0 1W * *

first weekday of the month at midnight

0 0 0 LW * *

last weekday of the month at midnight

Second Friday of the Month
The day-of-week field can be d#n (or DDD#n), which stands for the nth day of week d (or DDD) in the month.

Here are some examples:

Cron Expression

Meaning

0 0 0 ? * 5#2

the second Friday in the month at midnight

0 0 0 ? * MON#1

the first Monday in the month at midnight

Spring Scheduled tasks are not in the same format as cron expressions.

They don't follow the same format as UNIX cron expressions.

There are only 6 fields:

second,
minute,
hour,
day of month,
month,
day(s) of week.
Asterisk (*) means match any. */X means "every X" (see examples).

Numeric days of the week do not work for me. Besides, "MON-FRI" is much easier to read. Here are some example expressions:

"0 0 18 * * MON-FRI" means every weekday at 6:00 PM.

"0 0 */1 * * *" means every hour on the hour.

"0 0 */8 * * *" means every 8 hours on the hour.

"0 0 12 1 * *" means 12:00 PM on the first day of every month.
